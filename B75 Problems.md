## 217. Contains Duplicate

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

## 242. Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false


Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
